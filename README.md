# Friday Night Funkin': The Bread Mod
## Summary
A Friday Night Funkin' mod where you rap it out against a literal piece of bread. That's it. Runs on [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine). This repository contains, not just the mod itself, but the various source files that were used for the creation of its assets.

## How to install
- Unzip the contents of the mod into the "mods" folder of your Psych Engine build. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ql4CqFauSY) on how to do it.
